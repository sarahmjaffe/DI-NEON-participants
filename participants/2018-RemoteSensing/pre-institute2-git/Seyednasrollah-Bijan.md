I a postdoctoral data scientist with the network of phenological cameras or PhenoCam.  I obtained my PhD in quantitative environmental sciences, with backgrounds in engineering. I am interested in remote sensing techniques and Bayesian statistics in order to understand ecosystems' response to the changing environment.   

At PhenoCam, I use image processing and data science techniques to extract biologically meaningful time-series from stacks of images. As a part of my job, I create software tools that are used to obtain, process and analyze phenological data. 


## Proposed Capstone Project

For the capstone project I would to combine phenocam phenology data with NEON data sets to infer biological status of different ecosystems varying with environmental controls.
