# Bio
Hi, my name is Katharyn Duffy and I'll be attending the NEON workshop as a part of the Richardson lab.

# Domain of interest
I study the terrestrial biosphere, specifically how land-atmosphere carbon exchange responds to enviro-climatic change

# One goal for the course
I actually have 2:
1) Improve my git/collaborative science skills
2) Learn Python, I'm pretty new to it

# Capstone project idea
I've done some previous work looking at the temperature response of global carbon fluxes.  Given the repeat-photography data
stemming from NEON I'm interested in whether we can better constrain functional response of the terrestrial biosphere by parsing
data based on phenological season.

# Data I'm current considering:
-Flux data
-Phenological data
-Micrometeorological variables such as air and soil temperature, evapotranspiration, etc
