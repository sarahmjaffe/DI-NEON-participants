## Kelly Meehan

I am a Remote Sensing Analyst for Reclamation. I create landcover classifications for agricultural lands that have water rights along the Colorado River. These classifications are used to estimate actual evapotranspiration (as a proxy for consumptive use). I recently completed my masters at Duke University where I explored object based image analysis techniques for distinguishing native forest from plantations in the Atlantic Forest.  

My goals for the Data Institute include using LiDAR to improve the accuracy of classifications, as well as using python workflows for object-based image analysis. My hope is to utilize the skills learned in this class for a vegetation mapping project which will be used to identify potential survey and conservation project areas.

## Domain of Interest

Desert Southwest

## Proposed Capstone Project

For the capstone project, I hope to investigate the extent to which incorporating LiDAR data can outperform a classification using spectral data alone. I would like to use NEON discrete return LiDAR data, the vegetation indices mosaic, as well as the spectrometer orthorectified surface directional reflectance mosaic. I am interested in the Jornada LTER site in the Desert Southwest domain.
