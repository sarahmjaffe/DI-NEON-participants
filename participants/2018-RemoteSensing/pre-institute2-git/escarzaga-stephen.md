## NEON Data Institute 2018 Student Bio and Capstone Project Description: Stephen Escarzaga

### Bio

Hello all! My name is Stephen Escarzaga. I'm a first-year PhD student in the Environmental Science & Engineering Program at the 
University of Texas at El Paso. I'm supported as a PhD Fellow by a NOAA Educational Partnership grant, NOAA-CESSRST. My dissertation 
will focus around refining and evaluating various remote sensing techniques for characterizing arctic coastal and nearshore dynamics. 
Particularly, I'm interested in automated and semi-automated methods of coastline and coastal geomorphic feature extraction from 
high-resolution elevation and imagery datasets for estimating erosion and permafrost degradation. Additionally, I'm interested in 
optical modeling of near-shore/lagoon waters to understand how input of terrestrial carbon to these waters have changed overtime 
using field spectral sampling and archived datasets from satellite platforms like LandSat and Sentinel. I'm currently working on a 
project with a NOAA collaborator and mentor to create high-resolution digital elevation models using NOAA coastal airborne imagery 
and structure-from-motion techniques to extract actionable data products and estimate the extent of coastal erosion over a large 
swath of the Alaska coastline.

My domain of interest is the D18 Tundra domain located in the Barrow Environmental Observatory in what's now known as ***Utqiagvik***, Alaska.

My goal for this course is to walk away feeling comfortable with the RS data processing techniques used by NEON staff. In these techniques,
I see a potential to greatly increase the effeciency in my workflows as well as a sound and concise way to finally document everything I do.

### Capstone Project

MY capstone project revolves around a change analysis between NEON airborne LiDAR (2017) and coincident LiDAR flown by USGS (2010) in the D18 domain in Utqiagvik,
AK. The area covered includes many different geomorphic features such as coastal bluff, river banks, thawed lake basins, thermokarst and polygon
features. Additionally, the area is extremely hetergeneous in landcover and plant community cover. My idea is to determine areas of elevational change
depicting coastal erosion, thermokarsting and general permafrost degredation and river bank expansion. Then, using the higher-level data spectral data
products from the NEON AOP such as various water and vegetation indices to determine any strong relations ships between areas of change and observed
values in spectral index. This could aid in understanding surface hydrological and plant community processes in the context of degrading permafrost.
This will require careful consideration and work toward the standarization of coordinate systems and vertical datum for each LiDAR dataset. Discrete LiDAR
and spectral derivatives will be needed from NEON AOP. Conincident USGS LiDAR is freely available on EarthExplorer.
