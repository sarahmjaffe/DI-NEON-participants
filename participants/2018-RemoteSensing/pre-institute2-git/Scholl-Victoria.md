## Victoria Scholl

Hi! I'm a graduate student studying Geography at the University of 
Colorado Boulder. My focus is on using remote sensing to map forests 
and study their recovery after disturbances such as wildfire. 

I received a B.S. from Rochester Institute of Technology in Motion 
Picture Science and Imaging Science. These two unique programs focus on 
the capture, processing, and display of imagery for both artistic and 
scientific applications. Prior to starting grad school, I completed 
a U.S. Fulbright Research Fellowship in Switzerland, using airborne 
lidar to identify individual trees and improve forest inventory efforts. 
When I'm not coding, I enjoy rock climbing and hiking in the nearby mountains. 

## Proposed Capstone Project

I want to explore the integration of NEON field-based woody vegetation 
data and AOP products (RGB, hyperspectral, and lidar) to map individual 
species. Iâ€™d also like to incorporate NEON API calls into my workflow.
