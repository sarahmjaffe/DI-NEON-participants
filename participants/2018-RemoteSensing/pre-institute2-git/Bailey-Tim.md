## Biography
I am primarily interested in the biogeochemistry of soils. I have ongoing research into riparian soil formation processes in sediment impaired watersheds. My technical goals are to develop the ability to identify specific minerals from hyperspectral imagery. In my previous work I have used soil chronosequences to quantify landscape mineral weathering trajectories in tectonically active landscapes. Hyperspectral imagery has the potential to greatly enhance the perception of this phenomenon.

## Neon Summer Data Institute Capstone Research Proposal
I would like to test clay mineral expression in the hyperspectral imagery against local topographic variation in the low elevation grassland unit of the SJER. My hypotheses is that colluvial hollows will have much stronger soil development and expression of more highly  weathered clay mineralogy than the shallow granitic soils at higher landscape positions. Based on the mineralogy report on the Ahwanee soil profile descriptions collected by the NRCS at the SJER the dominant clay mineral is Kaolinite. I propose generating a series of relevant topographic derivatives such as upstream area, local relief, topographic texture and landform position. The assumption is that as parent material is weathered and mobilized as clay minerals will accumulate in the lower hillslope positions. I would then test the landscape position metrics against clay mineral signatures in the hyperspectral imagery. This is a rather obvious question but developing a quantified answer may have some utility.

## Data 
*Hyperspectral imagery
*Soil Chemistry from NRCS Pedon Descriptions
*Soil Chemistry from the Neon archive
*USGS spectral library for minerals

## Alternative Capstone Ideas
I have second idea that is much more poorly formed but is directly informed by the Neon programs interdisciplinary data architecture. It would be interesting to look at soil mineralogy development at the Central Great Plains site in Colorado. This site has Prairie Dog colonies which should be a major soil forming factor due to bioturbation of the soil profiles. If there are areas without Prairie Dogs within the site then it is possible the effect of the bioturbation could be explored with the imagery.

A third idea would be to look at the effect of the extreme drought with multitemporal hyperspectral imagery at the SJER site. Most of California entered into a historic extreme drought in 2012. The 2017 water year ended the drought. Coupling hyperspectral expression with soil moisture relationships could be an interesting avenue to explore across the period of observations.
