# Bio & Capstone Project Document

## Biographical Sketch

### About Me

My name is **Kris Voss** and I teach at Regis University in Denver, CO. I am an aquatic ecologist generally interested in understanding how aquatic ecosystems respond to land cover change in human dominated landscapes.  

### Goals for Workshop

I have two main goals for this workshop:

* To learn more about how to access and work with NEON remote sensing data using the tools in the workshop.
* To develop a short module for our graduate students that incorporates analysis of NEON remote sensing data into their required GIS class

## Capstone Project

### Project Idea

Because I am interested in aquatic ecosystems, I'm interested in relating hyperspectral remote sensing data to summaries of phytoplankton community structure and/or pigment data collected in situ. However, I realize that this information may be available at only a few of the aquatic fly-over locations, so I'd also be interested in working with anyone who is trying to relate hyperspectral data to terrestrial vegetation composition. In any case, this is likely a module I could include in the GIS class for our graduate students, so I could work on translating the work we do in a group project into a class activity.
