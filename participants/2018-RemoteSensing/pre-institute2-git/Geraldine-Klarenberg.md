# Bio for NEON Data Skills - Remote Sensing 2018: Geraldine Klarenberg

## About me

My name is Geraldine Klarenberg. I am currently a post doc at the University of Florida at the Department of Wildlife Ecology and Conservation. I have a PhD in Agricultural and Biological Engineering, University of Florida. I have a BSc/MSc in Tropical Landuse (Irrigation and Water Engineering) from Wageningen University, the Netherlands.
I am originally Dutch, and worked in Australia, the Fiji Islands and South Africa for my MSc. I then worked in South Africa for about 7 years with a Water and Sanitation NGO, before moving to the USA and doing my PhD at the University of Florida.
While I have worked on a multitude of projects, my main interest lies in the field of Coupled Natural Human Systems, system complexity and modeling of said systems (both statistical as well mechanistic modeling). My PhD research looked at the (potential) effects of highway paving in the Amazon on vegetation dynamics, which links to ecosystem services.

I am a certified Carpentry instructor and have taught a few Data Carpentry courses at UF; mostly on Excel and R.

My current research project is about ticks in Florida, and specifically the effects of invasive species (animals and plants) on ticks. While many people in my lab focus on pathogens associated with ticks, my work looks more at ticks themselves - but we hope to link this later to vector-borne diseases.
We are building an Agent-Based Model (ABM) to simulate ticks and hosts, and the environment. We are also working with tick data and invasive species data to establish occupancy and abundance rates, which we can then use for calibration of the model, as well as implement the model at various spatial scales.

## Domain of interest

I am specifically interested in the NEON data from the Southeast domain; the Jones Ecological Research Center in Georgia (core, terrestrial), the Disney Wildlife Preserve (relocatable, terrestrial) in Florida and mostly the Ordway Swisher Biological Station (core, terrestrial) in Florida. For now, I would focus on the latter, but I am interested in also using data from the other sites as they have different fire regimes and different moisture gradients.

## Goal for the course

Since the model I will be building will be in Python, I want to strengthen my Python skills. I ended up doing most of my PhD analyses in R (after briefly using Python) and I am keen to get back to Python.
I also want to get better acquianted with the NEON data for my locations of interest, as I believe they will be instrumental to my project. I am specifically interested in the LiDAR/vegetation/biomass data, and explore how these can be useful for my research.

## Capstone Project

I want to use the tick data of the abovementioned sites (Ordway Swisher primarily), as well as the data on mammals, vegetation such as species and biomass, and vegetation cover. Other data to include would be precipitation, temperature, herbaceous clip harvest, soil temperature, relative humidity, litterfall sampling
Data from other sources are elevation, distance to settlements, possibly EVI or NDVI. The Florida Geographic Data Library (www.fgdl.org) has most of this information.

I’d like to already have a basic occupancy model for ticks in Ordway Swisher developed before the workshop, and then use site and dynamic variables to estimate occupancy and detection probabilities. The results of this would also be interesting for the development of the ABM, as it gives some insight into which parameters might be important (which we will also formally test with a sensitivity and uncertainty analysis). 
Specifically for LiDAR information that this workshop focuses, I’d want to link species to the LiDAR data and do biomass calculations – and thus predict species and/or biomass for the whole of Ordway Swisher. If I can associate this with other variables in the occupancy model, I could make a spatial prediction of tick occupancy / abundance in Ordway Swisher.
