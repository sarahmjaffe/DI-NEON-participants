Hello everyone! I am a Geospatial Analyst with Attain at EPA Chesapeake Bay Program Office (CBPO). At the CBPO, I have been focused on developing the Chesapeake Bay Land Change Model (CBLCM) with Peter Claggett, Research Geographer with USGS. The model is designed to forecast future urban development in the Chesapeake Bay. My broader interests are landscape ecology, geomorpohology and geography and ecology of disease. 

### Course Goals
I am interested in learning about leveraging open source technologies to work with large LiDAR datasets, best practices and workflows. This information will be used in current and future planning of LiDAR derived products across the Chesapeake Bay Watershed.

### Capstone Project
One of the difficult things to identify through satellite imagery is vertical development in urban areas due to infill and redevelopment. The census data shows increase in number of housing units and jobs, but visual change is never detected in land use/land cover e.g. NLCD. The idea is to use LiDAR data to detect vertical urban development over time by focusing on a small urban area/town/city that has experienced rapid growth and redevelopment with multiple LiDAR datasets. Unfortunately, most of NEON's sites are removed from urban areas, so I'm currently in process of acquiring LiDAR point cloud data for multiple years in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Additional, analysis and verification can be performed by comparing existing data on simulated infill and redevelopment on Census Blocks.

The entire project depends on availability of LiDAR data, so I'll update the project immediately if I fail to acquire the data. Data needed: LiDAR for an urban area (multiple years)
