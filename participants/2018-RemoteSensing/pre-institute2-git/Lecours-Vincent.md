## Biography
I am a relatively new assistant professor at the University of Florida, in the Fisheries & Aquatic Sciences and Geomatics programs of the School of Forest Resources & Conservation. I am originally from Québec, the French-speaking province of Canada, where I completed a B.Sc. in Geomatics Applied to the Environment. My curriculum involved about 2/3 of courses in geomatics (terrestrial remote sensing, GIS, spatial analysis, surveying, cartography, computer sciences) and about 1/3 of courses in ecology and the environmental sciences. I then moved to the easternmost city in North America, St. John's (located in Newfoundland and Labrador), to complete my Ph.D. in marine geomatics with a focus on marine habitat mapping and seafloor mapping (acoustic remote sensing). While I worked mostly in the deep sea for my Ph.D. work, the nature of Florida's coastline makes me want to shift my focus towards studying coastal areas, which requires combining my current expertise in marine remote sensing and spatial analyses with my (partly-forgotten) expertise in terrestrial remote sensing.

## Interests

•	*Geomorphometry*, the science of quantitative terrain characterization from digital terrain models

•	*Marine habitat mapping*, the interdisciplinary, spatially-explicit characterization of the marine environment in terms of its physical, chemical, biological and ecological components

•	*Spatial sciences*, particularly acoustic remote sensing, spatial data quality and geostatistics

## Goal

My goal for the NEON Data Institute is to learn about the most recent methodological and technological developments in terrestrial remote sensing to see how I can integrate them with what is done in the marine environment. Also, since many of my colleagues at UF with whom I collaborate work on freshwater systems, I hope to learn about the opportunities for data collection and availability associated with NEON's aquatic sites.

## Capstone Project

For my project I would be interested in looking at the Barco Lake (NEON code BARC) and the Suggs Lake (NEON code SUGG) aquatic sites at the Ordway-Swisher Biological Station in central Florida. Part of my work in the oceans is to link the physical and chemical characteristics of the environment, in particular topographic variables like slope, aspect, rugosity, and topographic position, with the presence of specific vegetal and animal species. For this project I would like to look at the different data that are available at those sites and statistically delineate potential habitats (i.e. groups of areas that maximize intra-group similarity while minimizing between-group similarity using only abiotic variables), and then link those to the presence/absence and abundance of specific species. Those habitat maps could become useful spatial decision-making tools for management and conservation practices in the area.

For that project I would need Lidar elevation data (DEM), potentially bathymetric data for the lakes (although I don't think that they were collected yet), a variety of physical and chemical variables that may represent habitats, and presence and abundance data for target species.
