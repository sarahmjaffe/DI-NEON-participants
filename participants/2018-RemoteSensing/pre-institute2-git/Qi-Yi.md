## Bio

*My name is Yi Qi. I am interested in vegetation functional traits and composition variation. My goal is to learn skills to use NEON data.*

## Capstone Project
*I am interested to study drivers and responses of changes in vegetation traits and composition. I am interested to develop a capstone project in a NEON site near mid-west, such as sites in Colorado and Kansas. NEON AOP hyperspectral images and field vegetation leaf measurement (water content, pigment and so forth) are mostly relevant.*
