I have been researching biodiversity and climate change for 7 years in the non-profit and government sectors. I have dedicated this summer to improving my data science skills and am exited to learn more about remote sensing and lidar and how to turn this kind of information into actionable knowledge. 

## Capstone Project
I want to use aerial LiDar to identify where Pinyon-juniper vegetation types have encroached into areas that were historically sagebrush types. Juniper encroachment into shrub systems is one of the most prominent changes occurring in rangelands of western North America and is a conservation concern for sagebrush associated fauna such as the greater sage grouse. This analysis will be useful to test models that I have generated that aim to predict potential juniper encroachment based on recent climate change.

This idea is still in the brainstorming phase and I don't have list of data sources yet.
